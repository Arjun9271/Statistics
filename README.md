# 📊 Statistics Quick Recall for Interviews 🚀

## 🎯 **Key Concepts**

### 📌 Descriptive Statistics
- **Mean (Average)**: Sum of all values divided by the number of values.
- **Median**: Middle value when data is sorted.
- **Mode**: Most frequently occurring value.
- **Range**: Difference between maximum and minimum values.
- **Variance**: Measure of data spread (average of squared deviations).
- **Standard Deviation**: Square root of variance, indicates data spread.
- **Quartiles**: Divides data into four equal parts.

### 📌 Inferential Statistics
- **Population vs. Sample**:
  - Population: Entire group being studied.
  - Sample: Subset of the population.
- **Hypothesis Testing**:
  - Null Hypothesis (H₀): No effect or difference.
  - Alternative Hypothesis (H₁): Effect or difference exists.
- **p-value**: Probability of observing results under H₀. Low p (< 0.05) = reject H₀.
- **Confidence Interval (CI)**: Range where population parameter likely falls.

### 📌 Probability Distributions
- **Normal Distribution**: Bell-shaped curve. Mean = Median = Mode.
- **Binomial Distribution**: Fixed number of trials, two possible outcomes.
- **Poisson Distribution**: Models rare events over fixed intervals.
- **Uniform Distribution**: Equal probability for all outcomes.

### 📌 Correlation and Regression
- **Correlation**:
  - Measures relationship strength between variables.
  - Range: -1 (negative) to +1 (positive).
- **Regression**:
  - Linear Regression: Predicts dependent variable using independent variable(s).
  - Equation: `y = mx + c` (1 variable) or `y = b₀ + b₁x₁ + b₂x₂ + ...`

### 📌 Sampling Techniques
- **Random Sampling**: Every member has equal chance of selection.
- **Stratified Sampling**: Divides population into strata and samples proportionally.
- **Cluster Sampling**: Randomly selects entire clusters.
- **Systematic Sampling**: Every nth member is chosen.



## 🌟 **Useful Visuals**
- 📈 **Histograms**: Visualize data distributions.
- 📊 **Boxplots**: Summarize data spread and detect outliers.
- 📉 **Scatter Plots**: Show relationships between variables.
